### 🌐 [View Live Demo](https://iamsebas.dev)

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, meticulously crafted not just as a gallery of my work, but as a testament to modern, high-standard web development practices. The project emphasizes performance, developer experience (DX), and architectural robustness, built on a foundation of the latest industry-standard technologies.

## Core Philosophy

- **Bleeding-Edge Technology:** Leverages the latest stable versions of Next.js (v15.5), React (v19), and Tailwind CSS (v4) to build a future-proof and performant application.
- **Architectural Integrity:** Prioritizes a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture with a clear separation of concerns.
- **Developer Experience (DX):** A fully containerized development environment with Docker ensures a consistent and hassle-free setup. Strict linting, formatting, and TypeScript configurations are enforced to maintain code quality.
- **Performance First:** Optimized for speed through modern frameworks, a multi-stage production build, and efficient content pipelines.

## 🏛️ Architectural Deep Dive

This project is more than a simple website; it's a collection of deliberate engineering decisions.

### 1. Containerization Strategy (Docker)

The entire development and production lifecycle is containerized, providing consistency and eliminating "it works on my machine" issues.

- **Development (`Dockerfile.dev`):** A dedicated development environment with hot-reloading enabled through volume mounts, ensuring a fast and efficient feedback loop.
- **Production (`Dockerfile.prod`):** A multi-stage Docker build is used to create a lean, secure, and optimized production image. This process involves:
    1. A `builder` stage to install all dependencies and build the application.
    2. A `runner` stage that copies only the essential build artifacts (`.next`, `public`, `package.json`) and installs *only* production dependencies using `npm ci --omit=dev`. This dramatically reduces the final image size and attack surface.

### 2. Content Pipeline (MDX)

Project and blog content is managed through a decoupled and efficient MDX-based pipeline.

- **Source:** Content is written in `.mdx` files with YAML frontmatter for metadata.
- **Data Layer (`/lib`):** A dedicated data-fetching layer reads the MDX files from the filesystem. It uses `gray-matter` to parse the frontmatter and separate it from the main content.
- **Rendering:** On the page, `next-mdx-remote` is used to render the MDX content string. This approach is highly performant as it avoids server-side compilation of components, sending only the necessary data to the client.

### 3. Styling System

The styling is built on a modern, utility-first foundation that is both powerful and maintainable.

- **Tailwind CSS v4.1:** Utilizes the latest version, operating without an explicit `tailwind.config.ts` file and leveraging its new engine for improved performance.
- **CSS Variable-Based Theming:** Light and Dark modes are implemented in `globals.css` using CSS variables. This allows for dynamic, real-time theme switching without page reloads and is fully compatible with Tailwind's `theme()` function.

### 4. Code Quality & Type Safety

- **TypeScript Strict Mode:** The project enforces TypeScript's `strict: true` mode, ensuring maximum type safety and reducing runtime errors.
- **ESLint:** A strict ESLint configuration (`eslint: 9`) is in place to maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase.

## 🚀 Setup Guide

This is a quick reference for setting up the local development environment.

  1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/iamseb4s/personal-web.git
    cd personal-web
    ```

  2. **Build and run the development container:**
    This command builds the Docker image and starts the `dev-web` service in the background.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

  3. **Access the application:**
    The portfolio is now running in development mode and is accessible at [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030).
